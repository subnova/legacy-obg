    cottage situated in the centre of the picturesque 
    Derbyshire village of Winster. Some 200 years old, this cottage (which sleeps upto 4), was once 
    believed to be the local cobbler's house and workshop. Gingerbread Cottage has recently been restored and refurbished to 
    offer high standard accommodation, while retaining many period features including oak beamed ceilings and a large stone 
    fireplace in   the kitchen/dining room. To the front of the property is a secluded patio area with outdoor seating and barbeque.  
    The local village shop and pub are only a minute's stroll away
