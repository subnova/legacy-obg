   <h1>Allan's Helen's Trust Quiz Night &ndash; 25th October</h1>

   <p>Our Second Helen's Trust Quiz will follow the format of the first one
      &ndash; Allan's Quiz starts at 7:30pm and we will open the doors at
      6:30pm; pie & pea supper served from 8:15pm and the quiz then resumes
      at 9pm to finish around 9:45pm.  As it's a Tuesday we are opening
      especially and only for the quiz.</p>

   <p>As per last year, we are donating the entire takings from the evening
      to Helen's Trust, and we are hoping that someone will come along and
      say a few words on behalf of this most worthwhile charity &ndash; and
      the ladies are once again organising their raffle which is already
      being promoted in the Village Shop.</p>

   <p>Last year we hoped for &pound;500 and were stunned when we reached
      double that &ndash; we have great hopes that we can match it again
      this year &ndash; <b>but we do need your support.</b></p>

   <h2 class="heading">What do you have to do now?</h2>

   <p>Register your interest as soon as possible and choose your pie either
      by email or calling in.  Choice of pie:
      <ul>
        <li>Chicken &amp; Mushroom</li>
        <li>Steak in Ale</li>
        <li>Cheese &amp; Onion</li>
      </ul>
      (all served with mushy peas, chips &amp; gravy).</p>

   <p>If your register by email it would be helpful if you called in and
      paid your &pound;5 per head before the night.</p>

   <p>If you just want to come to the quiz without the supper you are very
      welcome &ndash; it's still a fiver though!</p>

   <p>And &ndash; if you cannot come along but wish to support us please
      feel free to drop in a donation.</p>

   <p>As per last year we will suspend Green Club Prices on the night too.</p>

   <p>Staff who come in have volunteered their time &ndash; please do support
      us.  We are offering places to our Green Club first and only if we don't
      fill up will we open it up to all comers.</p>

   <p>A huge thank you to Allan for once again preparing the quiz.  Team of up
      to four will be allowed, and you may bring a guest.</p>

   <p>Look forward to seeing you on the night.</p>
