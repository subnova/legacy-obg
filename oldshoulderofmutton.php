“Best B&B we have stayed in”

<p>5 of 5 stars Julia Powell - 22 Feb 2011</p>

Julie and Steven couldn't be more friendly and helpful. Their B&B has been lovingly refurbished to a very high standard and is extremely comfortable. The breakfast was outstanding too.. Will definitely stay with them the next time we are in the peak district.
